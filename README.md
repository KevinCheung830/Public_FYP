Hybrid Precoding of mmWave
Millimeter Wave (mm-Wave) communication can significantly enhance 5G cellular technology's capacity to meet increasing demands of high data rate software application and media access. However, its small wavelength reduces the propagation range and is sensitive to obstacles, causing notable pathloss.
To address the high path loss of mm-Wave communication ,Traditional precoding method, namely fully digital precoding appears to be a cost-inefficient solution due to high power consumption from the dedicated analog to digital converter (ADC) for each antenna. Therefore, hybrid precoding is introduced as a solution to reduce RF Chains by mapping multiple antennas to a single RF chain. It combines the merits of conventional methods, using phase shifters to steer the signal beam allows for beamforming of a phase array to direct the beam to designated direction for beamforming in the analog domain, and baseband precoding in the digital domain for flexible phase assignment and power allocation.
This paper assesses hybrid precoding algorithms for optimal performance. The hybrid precoding structure is reformatted as a matrix decomposition optimization problem using three methods: Optimal Unconstraint Precoding, Beam steering, and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit. Their performance is compared in terms of spectral efficiency to evaluate the hybrid precoding algorithm's effectiveness on using OMP.
